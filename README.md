# What is CDECRetrieve?

CDECRetrieve uses the web services provided by the California Data Exchange Center
[here](http://cdec.water.ca.gov/) as a backend to allow users to download 
data with a single function call. CDECRetrieve specifically uses the SHEF download
service due to the fact that it is the most robust of the services. You can learn 
more about the SHEF format [here](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/water/resources/SHEF_CodeManual_5July2012.pdf).

The design of this package maps different CDEC url endpoints into "services" that 
make sense. For example there is a **datasets** service that allows the user to 
view all datasets available at a given location. There is **query/data** service
that allows the user to bring observations into memory. The goal is to allow a
workflow where a user can pipe reponses from one service into another, and eventually
into the **data** service to get the data, and be able to automate this process.

Please see the *Details* section below for limitations and possible annoyances 
inherited from the CDEC service.

# Installation 

```r 
remotes::install_github("flowwest/CDECRetrieve")
```

# Basic Usage 

CDECRetrieve exposes several useful functions to query services from CDEC. 
The main function in the package is `cdec_query`, 

```r 
# download data from kwk, sensor 20, duration is event type
kwk_flow <- cdec_query("KWK", "20", "E", "2000-01-01", "2002-01-01")
```

The data returned,

```
# A tibble: 17,544 Ã— 5
   agency_cd            datetime location_id parameter_cd parameter_value
       <chr>              <dttm>       <chr>        <chr>           <chr>

2       CDEC 2000-01-01 01:00:00         KWK          20H            4937
3       CDEC 2000-01-01 02:00:00         KWK          20H            5234
4       CDEC 2000-01-01 03:00:00         KWK          20H            5234
5       CDEC 2000-01-01 04:00:00         KWK          20H            5273
6       CDEC 2000-01-01 05:00:00         KWK          20H            5282
7       CDEC 2000-01-01 06:00:00         KWK          20H            5090
8       CDEC 2000-01-01 07:00:00         KWK          20H            5023
9       CDEC 2000-01-01 08:00:00         KWK          20H            5014
10      CDEC 2000-01-01 09:00:00         KWK          20H            5023
# ... with 17,534 more rows
```

Visualize these flows,

```r 
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

kwk_flow %>% 
  filter(parameter_value >= 0) %>% # sentinel values -9998 and -9997 are present
  ggplot(aes(datetime, parameter_value)) + 
  geom_line()
```

*Note that appart from replacing sentinel values with appropriate NA values, 
the package does no QA/QC. This can be seen in the plot above, where suspicoius 
values are apparent.*
